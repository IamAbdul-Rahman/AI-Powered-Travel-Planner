# AI-Powered-Travel-Planner
The AI-Powered Travel Planner is an application designed to assist users in finding optimal travel options between a given source and destination. The system leverages LangChain and Google GenAI to process user inputs and generate various travel choices such as cab, train, bus, and flights, along with their estimated costs.

## Objective
- Develop an AI application that efficiently fetches travel information.
- Utilize LangChain to manage LLM-based interactions for user queries.
- Integrate Google GenAI for intelligent data processing and response generation.
- Ensure an intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.

## Features
- Personalized Travel Recommendations: The app uses LangChain‚Äôs chat-based models to suggest travel destinations based on user inputs.
- Interactive UI: The app is built with Streamlit, which provides a simple, user-friendly interface for users to interact with.
- Dynamic Itinerary Creation: Based on user queries, the app can generate itineraries and offer suggestions for different types of vacations (beach, cultural, adventure, etc.).
- Output Parsing: The model‚Äôs outputs are parsed and formatted for easy understanding.

## Components
- **User Interface (UI)**: A web-based application interface to collect user input.
- **LangChain Framework**: For managing LLM-based conversation flow.
- **Google GenAI Model**: To generate intelligent travel recommendations.

## Workflow
- User inputs source and destination in the application.
- The system processes the input using LangChain and Google GenAI.
- The model generates a structured response containing different travel modes and their estimated prices.
- The user receives the response with travel recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- User Interface: Streamli**t
- Framework: LangChain
- AI Model: Google GenAI

## Acknowledgments
- **LangChain** for providing the framework to build LLM-powered applications.
- **Google GenAI** for intelligent data processing and response generation.
- **Streamlit** for simplifying the creation of the user interface.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note  
This app relies on an AI API with **limited usage per minute**.  
If you repeatedly submit code for review, you may see a **"Resource Exhausted"** error.  
To resolve this:  
- Wait a few minutes and try again.  
- Avoid submitting too many queries in a short time.
